NPPS Supports DownLoadable Content (DLC) for Story and Songs. It requires SifEmu library to be present which depends on cURL and working SIF account in production server.

The DLC data is located in `dlc` folder. The structure of the folder is:

-dlc/
+-sifemu.php
+-data/
+-cache/

dlc/data contains files which consist of <type>_<id>.txt. The contents of the file will be explained below.
dlc/cache contains downloaded data from production server.

<type>_<id>.txt file format is JSON which contains all files for that package. Example:
[
	"assets/image/hello.texb",
	"assets/image/hello.png.imag",
	"assets/sound/my.mp3"
]

For audio, MP3 extension is always used, but it will check for OGG for Android OS.
