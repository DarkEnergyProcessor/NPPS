NPPS Supports DownLoadable Content (DLC) for Story and Songs. It requires SifEmu library to be present which depends on cURL and working SIF account in production server.

The DLC data is located in `dlc` folder. The structure of the folder is:

-dlc/
+-sifemu.php
+-data/
+-cache/

dlc/data contains files which consist of <type>_<id>_<os>.txt filename. The contents is a JSON array for the corresponding download_additional_id.
dlc/cache contains downloaded data from production server. The filename is the hash of the file contents.
