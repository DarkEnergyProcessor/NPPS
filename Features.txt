Features:
1. EXP calculation is round((21 + pow(i,2.12)) / 2).
2. The game can contain multiple events running in parallel, but it must be different type of event because SIF limitation.
3. It also can contain multiple scout boxes running in parallel. Like there's "Printemps" box while there's "Second-Year" and "Popular Selection" scouting running.
4. And even, it can contain multiple blue ticket scouts in parallel also.
5. You can add as many login bonus as you want. Not restricted

7. Live Show! notes can be modified under `data/notes` folder.
8. The WebView won't consume much bandwidh. It's designed to be like SIF JP webview while the webview base is from SIF EN
9. Secretbox webview link details will be automatically generated (and cached if necessary) by hashing it.

Limitations:
1. You'll always receive +5 FP (or +10 if it's your friend) if you use someone as your guest.
2. The secretbox can't distingush between normal card and event card. So it has same rate.

4. There's no gold bonus in token event.

Differences between original SIF EN server:

5. You can use scouting ticket even in custom pickup box (like in Printemps box).
